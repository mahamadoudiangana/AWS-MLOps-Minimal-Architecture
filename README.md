# _`AWS-MLOps-Minimal-Architecture`_

_`This setup is aimed at tackling all the Machine Learning life cycle hurdles while laying a scalable foundation.`_

# _`🚀#1 AWS MLOps Essentials! 🚀`_
_`After 3+ years of apprenticeship in 3 different continents in Data Science and MLOps across e-commerce, banking, and logistics, I’ve tackled many complex business challenges. Today, I want to share the minimal AWS MLOps setup that I believe every AWS MLOps engineer should keep in mind.`_

💡 Why Start with Minimal Architecture?
_`For many teams, ML workflows can be time-consuming, with manual processes for training, deploying, and monitoring models. Without the right MLOps practices, these can become bottlenecks to productivity, model accuracy, and cost-efficiency. This setup is aimed at tackling these hurdles while laying a scalable foundation.`_

# _`🔑 Essential AWS MLOps Components`_

_`#1. SageMaker Studio & Jupyter Notebooks – Centralized space for data scientists to build, train, and tune models.`_

_`#2. Data Sources – Access data in S3, RDS, Redshift, and more, helping with data integration and feature engineering.`_

_`#3. Versioning with CodeCommit & ECR – Store and track code changes and Docker containers to support reproducibility and collaboration.`_

_`#4. Automation with SageMaker Pipelines or Step Functions – Automate re-training workflows to minimize manual intervention.`_

_`#5. Model Registry – Manage model versions, track metadata, and maintain a record of models' lifecycle.`_

_`#6. Deployment with API Gateway, Lambda, and SageMaker Endpoints – Enable real-time predictions with auto-scaling for unexpected traffic spikes.`_

_`#7. Gradual Model Rollout with Canary Deployment – A controlled release to ensure model stability and quality.`_

# _`🔍 The Result?`_

_`By implementing these components, we achieve a serviceable and robust AWS MLOps architecture that supports efficiency, reliability, and scalability. This is a solid starting point for small teams, while larger teams might require a more complex setup as they grow.`_
